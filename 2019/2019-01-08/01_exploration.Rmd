```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
ratings_raw <- read_csv(here("data/2019/2019-01-08/IMDb_Economist_tv_ratings.csv"))
ratings_raw
```

# Exploration

Let's see what the genres look like. 
```{r}
ratings_raw %>% 
  filter(str_detect(genres, "Drama")) %>% 
  count()
```

Okay, so every row contains the word "Drama".

How many unique genre entries are there?
```{r}
unique(ratings_raw$genres)
```


## What the heck is "share"?

```{r}
hist(ratings_raw$share)
ratings_raw %>% 
  ggplot(aes(share)) +
  geom_freqpoly()

```


Let's try a fun plot to see ratings over time.

```{r}
ratings_raw  %>%  
  ggplot(aes(date, av_rating)) +
  geom_point()
```

What if I want to see a line for each show, connecting the seasons, on the above?

```{r}
ratings_raw %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = av_rating)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = title), alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```
